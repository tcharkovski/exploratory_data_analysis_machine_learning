# REDUCING THE CUSTOMERS CHURN RATE BY INSPECTING THE PowerCo COMPANY DATA-BASE USING PYTHON ANALYTICAL TOOLS TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSE OF THE CHURN AND USING A PREDICTIVE MODEL TO PREDICT THE CHURN
Working on this program as form part of the process of participating in a virtual internship organized by BCG [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/Tcz8gTtprzAS4xSoK?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=a954c4fd6f4fb1b5351cd1b37ec153630ff6caf2-1613484215-0-AXMx-eOqui32bQAL-pmCKjDBfHOAQQX9c2DC_c8K-h8FGoFMDl8D1SZyOeSlHHC14a8UPmojcp6VPf_wiMtg_Y2X3q-qJAPNQQbm45z1nkcyqV-QKgMb9J7qv78bEDeHvICkZAkVQ25Zix74F16BVjz8M-i-nH66uIsFr-u_jGnAHuTQihA864drkDXAwECw6pQ-Wveq8rGasTlOMnIrCYW4enB6jgOSZgzOQWXJy1tP2ULAq1pLpu1vSe1oLbmqZkgDEk_pyw3YmA5moXZQ7cuOY82nLFnmqG7VBPHyKXfuRIfEabQTBhdC4N_3Xs6NsFWp6W1zjgmCKwfN--Q_Btk1OTeFMJ7bJX7QWwp5Lv11mNZ1sgu4rGuvWlboFQSX_0X4twyKsZe3hlnBrVKsA2lhV_owTXAfECJ2Xy9h5m-H9EYboNoTscwEK1PkmKbfoKY5FsYVlrkWntFInG2js6-GTXA95gtTLcQwvXctrBVwb-wGTYbDqEiUKhfYqfKNb16x_W0m45kbM_i42OJ2EYgIv6Lq6Ua-vqAjLUZ-Dfx3wINyYEzU7TN6Z0W8nfB9LY4oZWJv7EB1SKToMYaMGf4&ref=GoHyMBiPYPB6BJbqx) formally known as InsideSherpa, the internship was supervised by BCG Open-Access Data Science & Advanced Analytics Virtual Experience Program.

The project was collectively worked on by [**Mr. (Pythonista) Eden Godwin**](https://github.com/tcharkovski) and [**Engr Carnot**](https://github.com/tcharkovski). We had to be part of this process not only to have something to add to our portfolio/CV but to acquire industrial knowledge of what is expected of a data scientist in the industry and also to validate and consolidate on our existing knowledge.

In the course of the project we were expected to work on a client data and the client for the project is 
>PowerCo, a major utilities company. 

PowerCo has had declining profits due to significant customer churn. 
>It is expected of us to use provided data for PowerCo to drive churn reduction in the company.

All *codes* used during the course of program where ran on ***jupyter lab and jupyter notebook***, this is because jupyter lab and jupyter notebook gives us the advantage of running our codes in batches aside this, it is easier to debug code using jupyter lab and jupyter notebook.

Libraries used in the course of running our codes includes but are not limited to 
>numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn etc. 

*to get a good feel of all the libraries used during the course of the project we will strongly advance you follow the notebook in each folder.*

_This internship has been segmented into five stage namely:_
*	Business Understanding and Problem Framing
*	Exploration Data Analysis and Data Cleaning
*	Feature Engineering
*	Modeling and Evaluation
*	Insights and Recommendation
